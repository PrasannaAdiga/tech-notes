## What is cloud computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the intrenet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology/computing services, such as network, physical/virtual servers, appliccations, storage and services, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider.

## Why people use cloud computing
People use cloud computing because of its convenience, reliability, affordability and accessibility. It helps facilitate the management of data, storage, applications, security and compliance to name a few.

## Characteristics of cloud computing
- **On demand self-service**: Provisioning or de-provisiong computing resources as needed through a simple interface without human intervention.
- **Broad network access**: Access computing facilities from anywhere over a network by using mechanisms and platforms such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and workstations.
- **Resource pooling**: Resources are dynamically assigned and/or allocated to meet the client's demand. Typically the client is not concerned about the physical location of the resources but may specify the country or region if that is a requirement.
- **Rapid elasticity**: Allow access for more resorces when there is a surge of traffic in the cloud and scale back and release the resources when it is not needed.
- **Measured service**: The client only pays for the resources that they use.

## Benifits of cloud computing
- **Cost**: Allows users to purchase capacity and services as they are being used. It uses remote resources that are shared with other clients and save on the cost of servers, physical equipments and IT.
- **Flexible**: It provides on-demand scaling based on the needs of each workload. Users have the choice of cloud deployment models between public, private or hybrid.
- **Efficient**: Cloud apps and data are accessible from any device that has an internet connection. 
- **Secure**: VPC, encryption and APIs can help secure data and other information. Hardware failures do not result in the data loss because there are redundant backups in the cloud.
