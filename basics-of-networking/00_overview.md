# Overview

## What is a network?
In its simplest form, a network is nothing more than “two connected computers sharing resources with one another.”

For example two computers connected to each other through wires and cables which are connected to NIC of each computer and share/transfer the data back and forth by using different protocols.

It is composed of two main aspects:
- Physical Connection (wires, cables, wireless media)
- Logical Connection (data transporting across the physical media)

## Some basic networking rules
- The computers in a network must use the same procedures for sending and receiving data. We call these communication protocols.
- Data must be delivered uncorrupted. If it is corrupted, it’s useless. (There are Exceptions)
- Computers in a network must be capable of determining the origin and destination of a piece of information, i.e., its IP and Mac Address.

## Type of Computer Networks (by size)
- Personal Area Network (PAN)
- Local Area Network (LAN)
- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
- Campus Area Network (CAN)
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- Wide Area Network (WAN)

### Personal Area Network (PAN)
- Ultra-small networks used for personal use to share data from one device to another.
- Can be wired (PAN) or wireless (WPAN): 
    - USB
    - Bluetooth
    - NFC
    - ANT+
- Examples:
    - Smart Phone to Laptop
    - Smart Watch to Smart Phone
    - Smart Phone Hands-Free Car Calling 
    - Heart Rate Monitor to Smart Phone

### Local Area Network (LAN)
A computer network within a small geographical area, such as a single room, building or group of buildings.

Considered to be self-contained:
- All devices are directly connected via cables and/or short-range wireless technology.
- Doesn’t require a leased telecommunications line from an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Examples:
- Home Network
- Small Business or Office Network

### Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
- A LAN that’s dependent on wireless connectivity or one that extends a traditional wired LAN to a wireless LAN.
- Most home networks are WLANs

### Campus Area Network (CAN)
- A computer network of multiple interconnected LANs in a limited geographical area, such as a corporate business park, government agency, or university campus.
- Typically owned or used by a single entity.

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- A computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a city.
- Larger than a campus area network, but smaller than a wide area network.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)
- A computer network that extends over a large geographical distance, typically multiple cities and countries.
- WANs connect geographically distant LANs.
- Typically use leased telecommunications lines from ISPs.
- Examples:
    - The Internet
    - Corporate Offices in Different States

## Network Architecture

### Peer-to-Peer(decentralised)
- All computers on the network are peers
    - No dedicated servers
    - There’s no centralized control over shared resources
- Any device can share its resources as it pleases
- All computers can act as either a client or a server
- Easy to set-up, and common in homes and small businesses    

### Client-Server(centralised)
- The network is composed of client and servers
    - Servers provide resources
    - Clients receive resources
- Servers provide centralized control over network resources (files, printers, etc.)
- Centralizes user accounts, security, and access controls to simplify network administration
- More difficult to setup and requires an IT administrator    

## Why Build a Computer Network?
- Before computer networks, people sent and received information by hand, using the postal service. This is slow and can be unreliable.
- Computer networks enable faster, more efficient modes of communication, i.e., email, video conferencing, etc.
- Computer networks and the sharing of electronic data encourage the use of standard policies and procedures.
- Computer networks provide backup and recovery support for our data, i.e., redundancy.
- Computer networks lead to cost savings.
