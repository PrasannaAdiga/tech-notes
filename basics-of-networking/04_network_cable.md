# Network Cable

## Ethernet Cable
- Ethernet is a network protocol that controls how data is transmitted over a LAN.
- It has both physical and logical components.
- It’s referred to as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 Standard.
- It supports networks built with coaxial, twisted-pair, and fiber-optic cabling.
- The original Ethernet standard supported 10Mbps speeds, but the latest supports much faster gigabit speeds.
- Ethernet uses CSMA/CD(wired) & CSMA/CA(wireless) access methodology, which is the logical component.

## Ethernet `N<Signaling>-X` Naming
Ethernet uses an “xx Base T” naming convention: 10Base-T 
- N: Signaling Rate, i.e., Speed of the cable.
- <Signaling>: Signaling Type: Baseband (Base) communication. 
- X: Type of cable (twisted pair or fiber).

### Coaxial Cable
- Antiquated technology used in the 1980s. Coaxial cables are rarely used today, except for cable modem connections.
- Categorized as Radio Grade (RG)
    - RG-6: Used for modern cable TV and broadband cable modems. o RG-8: Used in early 10Base5 “Thick-net” Ethernet networks.
    - RG-58: Used in early 10Base2 “Thin-net” Ethernet networks.
    - RG-59: Used for closed-circuit TV (CCTV) networks
- Metallic shield helps protect against electromagnetic interference (EMI)

### Twisted Pair Copper Cabling
- 4 Twisted Pairs of Wires with RJ-45 Connector
- Balanced pair operation
    - + & - Signals
    - Equal & Opposite Signal 
- Why are they twisted?
    - To Help Reduce Interference
        - Crosstalk
        - Noise (Electromagnetic Interference)
- Security concerns
    - Signal Emanations
- 100 Meters Maximum Distance
    - Signal Attenuation
